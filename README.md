# gtk-theme-ubuntustudio-legacy
Port of circa 2008 era UbuntuStudio GTK theme to GTK3, with selected color changed to a blue-green


Makefiles have NOT been created for this yet, so until they are, to install just drag the entire "UbuntuStudio_Legacy" directory to /usr/share/themes and set permissions to allow all users to "access files" and root only to write to them
